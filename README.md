## About The Project

This is a project given by GDSC. They instructed us to create a responsive navbar and incorporate it into any webpage. However, I realized that a navbar is a common element found on nearly every webpage. So, why not create an entire website dedicated to it? On this website, users can browse different navbars and choose that best looking one and easily integrate them into their projects.

Here is a quick look of the page -
